        "1 What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- data structures aren't a programming language or an application, but rather a set of rules and relationships for arranging data.\n",
        "** data structure are importace-**\n",
        "                  Data structures are crucial because they directly impact the efficiency, performance, and scalability of a program. Choosing the right data structure can be the difference between a program that runs instantly and one that takes hours to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-**Mutable data type -** Mutable data types are objects whose value can be changed in place after creation. This means you can add, remove, or change elements without creating a new object in memory.\n",
        "  example-   \n",
        "          my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "              my_list.append(4)\n",
        "              my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        " **Immutable data type-**\n",
        "            Immutable data types are objects whose value cannot be changed after they are created.\n",
        "      exampe-\n",
        "            my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "            new_string = my_string + \" world\"\n",
        "            my_string is still \"hello\"\n",
        "            a new object, new_string, holds \"hello world\"\n",

        "         my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list\n",
        "         my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Python dictionaries are implemented using a hash table (or hash map). This is an underlying data structure that allows for very fast lookups.\n",
        "1.Hashing the Key\n",
        "2.Storing the Pair\n",

        "     'city': 'New York'\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n",
        "Ans:-You might use a set instead of a list in Python for a few key reasons, primarily when you need to store a collection of unique items and require fast look-up times. Sets are also useful when the order of elements doesn't matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "viewed_products_list = ['milk', 'bread', 'milk', 'cheese', 'bread', 'cheese']\n",
        "\n",

        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- string in Python - A string in Python is a sequence of characters, used to represent text. You create a string by enclosing a sequence of characters in single, double, or triple quotes.\n",
        " example -\n",
        "         string using single quotes\n",
